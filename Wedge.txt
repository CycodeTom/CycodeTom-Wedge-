The Wedge is in Newport Beach, Califoirnia
It was formed by the cronstruction of the Newport Beach Harbor entrance in 1932
Swells tend to collide with the breakwater (or jetty as it is sometimes called) and refract (or bounce) back out into the water and collides with the next approaching swell
The added engery of these two waves coming together causes a "wedge" type reaction which that doubles or triples the size of the wave
This is what the Wedge is famous for
Very large waves 
These waves are ridden by people using nothing more than their bodies and can also be ridden by people using boards such as sufrboards 
There seems to be tension between bodysurfers and board riders
The Blackball flag at the Wedge means that no boards are allowed in the water whaile the balckball flag is observed
The lifegaurd tower is the place where the blackball flag will be shown
